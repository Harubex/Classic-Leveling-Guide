# Classic Leveling Guide

A guide for leveling an Alliance character through World of Warcraft Classic. Originally designed for hardcore, but can be used with a softcore character as well. It may be expanded to support Horde and non-human starts eventually.

## Current Features
* A dynamically updated visual display of your route. Many guides with map views are only offered as static images, which hinders their usability.
* A quest log view that dynamically displays your current quests at any step. Its easy with a lot of guides to get lost and end up unsure which quests should still be held onto. This view makes it clear which quests you should have, and offers links to the [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com) page for each.
* A route that emphasizes completionism over speed. While the route is still meant to be efficient, it tries to offer a balance between leveling speed and keeping up with non-essential tasks, such as doing dungeon quests and leveling professions.
* Markers for dangerous zones. Especially useful for hardcore characters, many zones in the game contain mobs that will quickly kill a player following this guide if they get too close. This guide aims to mark each of these danger zones on the map in a way that makes them easy to identify and avoid.
